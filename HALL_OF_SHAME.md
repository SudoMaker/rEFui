# Hall of Shame

[InspacialLabs](https://github.com/inspatiallabs/inspatial-dev) rebrands rEFui with AI, without attribution(and done poorly).

They later added a [`CREDITS.md`](https://github.com/inspatiallabs/inspatial-dev/blob/33aaad73c88898dfe6192347bddab7be20f7f1d8/CREDITS.md) in [this commit](https://github.com/inspatiallabs/inspatial-dev/commit/894051b76a73fdc166fad90053757c25524c2580), but still violating all of the well known licenses: all licenses used in the projects they copycat require containing a copy of the original license, and crediting the code in each file respectively.

Referring to rEFui, the credit is even more hilarious: they never got the spelling correct even once: the name is `r E F u i`, with `r`, `u`, `i` in lower case and `E`, `F` in upper case. But they write `RefUI` everywhere, in their direct messages to me and in this `CREDITS.md`. This is a typical behavior of cheap AI models, while combining of the extensive usage of emojis in this documentation, it's very clear that they never actually read the code of rEFui, all of the jobs are done by AI and even the `CREDITS.md` is generated by AI as well, showing no respect to the original projects at all.

In the section `üíñ Our Commitment to Open Source`, they write:

> We understand that we can't acknowledge every project that has influenced our work‚Äîthe open source ecosystem is vast and interconnected. Here's how we're giving back:
>
> - üéØ Active Sponsorship: We sponsor open source projects that power our development
> - üîÑ Contributing Back: We contribute improvements, bug fixes, and features upstream
> - üìñ Knowledge Sharing: We open source our own innovations when possible`

Please DO NOT TURST ANY WORD THEY SAY. They're very good at lingual manipulation. They have totally no ability to contribute back, nor sharing any of their knowledge. They never clearly answered my questions, only vaguely promising their "sponsorship" and "job offers" at a really low price considering what things they want me to do.

After they laundered the code from rEFui, they also generated a sample project with AI[^2], but failed to get it running. So they reached me and ask me to fix it. I was already suspicious about their ability to code, so I didn't give them a direct fix, but point out a very obvious error the AI wrotes. They didn't get it. Anyone who read the README of rEFui with little JSX knowledge should know what's wrong.

Days later, they come to me and say they get it running without my help. I asked them again what's wrong about that line of code, they refused to answer, clearly showing that they still used AI to correct the problem, but not understanding the code themselves.

## Whole timeline about this incident:

* **2025-05-28**: benemma expresses admiration for ClassicOldSong's work and introduces the idea of collaborating on [InSpatial](https://github.com/inspatiallabs).

* **2025-06-03 to 2025-06-04**: ClassicOldSong first raises suspicion about benemma‚Äôs technical understanding, specifically noting benemma's incorrect assumptions about how Deno serves files and transforms JSX[^1].

* **2025-06-29**: Extensive discussion about potential collaboration. ClassicOldSong expresses concerns about the feasibility, their technical constraints, and personal challenges. benemma proposes exploring new collaborative directions, promising flexibility and openness.

* **2025-06-29 to 2025-06-30**: benemma proposes a formal collaboration or acquisition of ClassicOldSong‚Äôs projects, emphasizing shared ownership. ClassicOldSong remains skeptical due to ambitious promises and practical concerns about the collaboration's goals.

* **2025-07-21**: benemma requests a RefUI template using Deno's new esbuild support. ClassicOldSong explains that this would require substantial work, essentially creating a new meta-framework.

* **2025-07-24**: benemma introduces "@inspatial/run", a rebranded version of RefUI using AI-generated code. ClassicOldSong quickly identifies significant issues, including incorrect basic JSX usage and missing proper MIT license attribution. ClassicOldSong also explicitly questions benemma's technical understanding due to fundamental mistakes[^2] in the presented code.

* **2025-07-24 to 2025-07-29**: ClassicOldSong repeatedly highlights basic technical mistakes in benemma‚Äôs code and explicitly questions benemma‚Äôs understanding of JSX, React, and Deno. Despite multiple hints and requests for clarification, benemma avoids addressing technical questions directly, reinforcing ClassicOldSong‚Äôs suspicions about his technical competence and honesty.

* **2025-07-29**: The conversation escalates as ClassicOldSong directly challenges benemma to answer straightforward technical questions, pointing out benemma‚Äôs consistent avoidance of technical clarity. benemma admits limited coding abilities but maintains respect and admiration for ClassicOldSong‚Äôs work. ClassicOldSong ultimately rejects further collaboration and sponsorship, citing significant doubts about benemma‚Äôs honesty and capability.

## 2  Methodology

1. **Commit-history scan** of [https://github.com/inspatiallabs/inspatial-dev](https://github.com/inspatiallabs/inspatial-dev) found large ‚Äúinitial‚Äù commits in April 2025 that add thousands of lines at once, followed by cosmetic refactors.
2. **Line-level diff**: raw source of each InSpatial file was compared to upstream raw files (via GitHub and JSR).
3. **Licence check**: headers in upstream files (MIT/Apache-2.0) vs. headers (or lack thereof) in InSpatial copies.
4. **Timeline**: correlated commits that drop code, rename symbols, or replace licence text.

---

## 3  Detailed code comparisons

### 3.1 `signal.ts` (**@inspatial/run**) vs `signal.js` (rEFui) ‚Äî complete copy

| rEFui `signal.js`                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | InSpatial `signal.ts`                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `js<br>// Licensed to the Apache ‚Ä¶<br>export const runQueue = [];<br>export function scheduleSignal(s) { ‚Ä¶ }<br>export function flushRunQueue() { ‚Ä¶ }<br>export function createDisposer() { ‚Ä¶ }<br>export function pure(fn) { ‚Ä¶ }<br>` | `ts<br>// (no licence header)<br>export const runQueue = [];<br>export function scheduleSignal(s) { ‚Ä¶ }<br>export function flushRunQueue() { ‚Ä¶ }<br>export function createDisposer() { ‚Ä¶ }<br>export function pure(fn) { ‚Ä¶ }<br>` |

* All function bodies are byte-for-byte identical; only imports are rewritten from `refui/utils` ‚Üí `./utils`.
* Internal flag names (`_dirty`, `_subs`) and global arrays match exactly.
* **Conclusion:** entire reactive-signal implementation is copied, not just the scheduler/disposer.

### 3.2 Hot-module-replacement

| rEFui `hmr.js`                                                                                                    | InSpatial `hot/hot-reload/index.ts`                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Constants `KEY_HMRWRAP`, `KEY_HMRWRAPPED`; `wrapComponent`, `enableHMR`, `update`, `setup`.  Logs `[rEFui HMR] ‚Ä¶` | Identical constants renamed to `KEY_HOTWRAP`, `KEY_HOTWRAPPED`; same functions, logs `[InSpatial] ‚Ä¶` |

### 3.3 Control-flow helpers

* InSpatial `kit/control-flow/if/index.ts` replicates rEFui‚Äôs `If` component logic (signal-aware condition evaluation) with only variable renames.
* InSpatial `kit/control-flow/list/index.ts` mirrors rEFui‚Äôs keyed diff algorithm used in its `For`/`List` helper.  Loop indexes, sentinel constants, and DOM-patch logic are identical.

### 3.4 DOM shim

| undom-ng (MIT)                                                                                                    | InSpatial DOM                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Event`, `EventTarget`, flag `__undom_event_stop`, passive-event warning ‚Äú\[UNDOM-NG] Unable to preventDefault ‚Ä¶‚Äù | Same code with flag renamed `__indom_event_stop`, warning prefix changed to `[InDOM] Unable ‚Ä¶` |

No MIT header retained.

### 3.5 Assertion library

| Deno std `assertStringIncludes`                                                      | InSpatial `assertStringIncludes`                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MIT header, 10-line body throwing `AssertionError` when `!actual.includes(expected)` | No header, identical implementation with extra docs, same error text composition. |

### 3.6 ANSI colour utilities

* InSpatial `theme/src/color/index.ts` implements `rgb24`, `bgRgb24`, and uses the same **ANSI\_REGEX** as chalk‚Äôs `ansi-regex` (acknowledged only in a comment).
* No MIT licence from chalk/kleur is present.

### 3.7 ArkType re-export

* InSpatial Type simply `import ‚Ä¶ from "npm:arktype@^2.1.16"` and re-exports the same symbols under new names (`configureType`, `defineType`, etc.).

### 3.8 mime-types data

* `cloud-client/src/mime-types/*.json` match the structure and content of the upstream `mime-db` project.  Code constructs lookup tables identical to the MIT-licensed `mime-types` NPM module.

| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apr 10‚Äì14** | Bulk ‚Äúinit‚Äù commits adding `@inspatial/run`, `@inspatial/dom`, `@inspatial/type`, `@inspatial/test`.                          | DOM commit adds **+4,330‚Äâ/‚Äâ‚àí358** lines in one shot labelled *‚Äúchore(dom)‚Äù* (no attribution). |
| Apr 15‚Äì22     | Rapid ‚Äúrefactor‚Äù/‚Äúrename‚Äù passes (e.g. `parseHTML` ‚Üí `InSpatialDOM`, `CSSselect` ‚Üí `ISSSelector`).                            | Commits labelled *refactor* but primarily rename upstream identifiers.                        |
| May 12‚Äì16     | New modules Motion, Interact (signal-lite).  Commit messages *‚Äúfeat(interact): Signal-Lite Init‚Äù* then multiple refactors.    | First commit adds \~1 kLoC; follow-ups change variable names and comments.                    |
| **Jul 21‚Äì22** | Licence consolidation: commit titled *‚ÄúUpdate license references‚Äù* replaces MIT/Apache text with **Intentional-License-1.0**. | Mass-edit across docs and headers.                                                            |

Pattern: **large code drops ‚Üí superficial refactor ‚Üí licence stripping ‚Üí proprietary re-branding**.

---

## 5  Licensing and compliance implications

* **Apache-2.0 and MIT** both require preservation of licence notice and copyright.
* InSpatial removes these headers and re-licenses under *Intentional-1.0*, whose terms prohibit ‚Äúcompeting use‚Äù and commercial redistribution, directly conflicting with the upstream licences.
* Such relicensing without permission violates ¬ß4 of Apache-2.0 and the MIT licence‚Äôs attribution clause.

---

## 6  Conclusion

The commit history, line-level code comparison, and licence changes show a **systematic pattern of open-source code laundering**:

1. **Whole modules** from rEFui, undom-ng, Deno std, ArkType, chalk/kleur, mime-db (and possibly Prisma/Drizzle) are imported en masse.
2. **Immediate refactors** rename identifiers and strip comments/licences, while commit messages frame these as minor chores.
3. **Proprietary re-licensing** under ‚ÄúIntentional-1.0‚Äù removes users‚Äô freedom granted by MIT/Apache and violates those licences.

Developers are advised to treat all InSpatial Dev packages as **non-compliant forks** of upstream projects.  For legally safe usage, depend directly on rEFui, undom-ng, Deno std, ArkType, etc., which remain fully open-source and properly licensed.
