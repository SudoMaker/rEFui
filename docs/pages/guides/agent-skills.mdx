# Agent Skills

This repository includes an AI agent “skill pack” for rEFui at `skills/refui`. It is designed to help you implement requirements using rEFui’s existing primitives first (signals, built-in components, extras, renderers), and only fall back to custom code when rEFui doesn’t already provide a suitable solution.

## Install

The skill lives at `skills/refui` in this repo.

### For Codex CLI

Install it by copying it into your `$CODEX_HOME/skills` folder:

```sh
mkdir -p "$CODEX_HOME/skills"
cp -R skills/refui "$CODEX_HOME/skills/refui"
```

### For Gemini CLI

Install the skill from the project root:

```sh
mkdir -p ./gemini/skills # for workspace
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/skills # globally
cp -R skills/refui ./gemini/skills
```

Activate the skill:
- "/skills enable refui" (in interactive mode)

### For other agents

- In the installed folder, treat `SKILL.md` as the entrypoint “playbook”.
- Load `references/*.md` selectively for the task at hand (async UI, portals, lists/perf, etc.).
- Optionally run `scripts/refui-audit.mjs` from inside the installed skill folder as a lightweight project scan (Node.js required).

## Use

Mention the skill name (or otherwise enable the pack in your agent) so it loads its workflow + references.

Examples (for Codex CLI):

- “Use the `refui` skill to implement a modal with a portal.”
- “Use `$refui` and help debug why my UI isn’t updating.”

Examples (for Gemini CLI):

- “Activate the `refui` skill and implement a counter.”
- “Use the `refui` skill to refactor this component to use signals.”
- “/skills enable refui” followed by “Help me optimize this list rendering.”

## When you’re unsure

If you’re using rEFui as a dependency and can’t inspect its source, the skill instructs agents to consult MCP documentation sources (Context7 / DeepWiki) before guessing (when MCP is available).
